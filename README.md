# React Grid

Data grid for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react)


## Getting started
0. you'll need node, and an editor. Till visual studio does JSX, we think Atom.io is the best, so if you dont already, grab them:
 
		choco install atom
		choco install nodejs.install *if typing npm gives you an error*
		git clone https://github.com/adazzle/react-grid *in the root directory you want your files in*
		cd .\react-grid

1. You'll also need Gulp which will perform build tasks such as jsx compilation (specified in gulpfile.js) - Go get it:
		
		npm install -g gulp
		npm install --save-dev gulp 

2. Install Project Dependencies from package.json file 
		
		npm install

3. Run gulp. It compiles your jsx, jshint, packs your scripts up, and fires up a local webserver and opens the start page
		
		gulp
	
Have a look in the gulpfile for other commands or add your own
